## b_in exit handling argv
## fix leaks at cmd_prep_utils.c and rmv_quotes_xpnd_var
## cd update env
## fixed read_line leaks by cleaning extralines using ft_arrclear; relevant when pasting cmds.
## updated better_add_history to only add history when necesary 
#	and only checking the last item in history, rather than going through all of them. Still some leaks from tokenise_type. I will move on to other tasks as I know you are still making changes to the tokeniser

current_history based on tokens, handle heredoc
redirects in b_ins
exit fuctions
catch all malloc fails (look up: ft_calloc)
CMD error message:
