## b_in exit handling argv
## fix leaks at cmd_prep_utils.c and rmv_quotes_xpnd_var
## cd update env
## fixed read_line leaks by cleaning extralines using ft_arrclear; relevant when pasting cmds.
## updated better_add_history to only add history when necesary 
#	and only checking the last item in history, rather than going through all of them. Still some leaks from tokenise_type. I will move on to other tasks as I know you are still making changes to the tokeniser

## update PWD and OLDPWD at launch
## cd = OLDPWD update when PWD unset
## current_history based on tokens, 
## CMD error message handling and exit code when S_ISDIR and Command not found.
## cmd_prep = a="cho 123" ; e$a
## exit fuctions
## handle heredoc history - from next_line??
## redirect subshell
## better_add history updated to use allowed functions only
redirects in b_ins
catch all malloc fails (look up: ft_calloc)
